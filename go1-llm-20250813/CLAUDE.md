## Project Overview

This is a multi-timer application project built with TypeScript and Node.js. The application allows users to:
- Set multiple timer marks in advance (e.g., 5min00, 10min15)
- Visual notifications (red blinking) when each mark is reached
- 2-decimal digit precision timing
- Can be deployed as either a Windows executable or web application
