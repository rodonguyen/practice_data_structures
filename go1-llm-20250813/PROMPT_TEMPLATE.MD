- I want to build a a multi-timer for my own use, it should be an executable     
windows or web app. I should have the ability to set the marks in advances, like       
5min00, 10min15, make UI convenient to set, and after each mark the timer will blink red 3 times
then continue to run if there's more marks left. while the clock is running, it should 2-decimal
digits precise.

- Write your plan to IMPLEMENTATION.md, update it as we discuss, use it as your memory
- With the above information, show me HOW you plan to build this app and WHY you choose that          
approach                                                                                              
- If suitable, provide short code snippets of the core parts so that people understand you quicker    
- Apply good system designs, design patterns, build clean and maintainable codebase.                  
- DO NOT CODE UNTIL WE FINISH DECIDED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
